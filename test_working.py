#from working import convert: This line imports a function named convert from a module named working. We don't have the code for the convert function, but we can assume it's defined in a separate file named working.py.
#import pytest: Imports the pytest library, which is used for writing and running tests.
#def main():: Defines a main function that calls two other functions, test1 and test2.
def main():
    test1()
    test2()
#def test1():: Defines a test function named test1.
#assert convert("9 AM to 5 PM") == "09:00 to 17:00": This line asserts that the convert function, when given the input "9 AM to 5 PM", returns the string "09:00 to 17:00". If the returned value is different, a test failure occurs.
#The following three lines perform similar assertions for different input-output pairs.

    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        convert("9:60 AM to 5:60 PM")

#The code defines two test functions to verify the behavior of the convert function. test1 checks if the function correctly converts 12-hour time formats to 24-hour formats. test2 ensures that the function raises a ValueError for invalid input formats.
