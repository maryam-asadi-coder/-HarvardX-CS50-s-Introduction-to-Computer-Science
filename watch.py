#This line imports the re module in Python. This module provides functions for working with regular expressions, which are powerful tools for pattern matching in text.

#This line imports the sys module, which provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. While not directly used in this code for parsing the YouTube embed URL, it's often a common import to have flexibility for future enhancements.
import sys

#This line defines a function named main(). This function is the main entry point of the script. When you run the script, the code execution starts from this function.
def main():
    print(parse(input("HTML: ")))
#This line is inside the main() function. It does two things:
#input("HTML: "): This part prompts the user to enter some HTML content. It waits for the user to type something and press Enter. The entered text is then stored in the variable s.
#print(parse(s)): This part calls the parse() function, passing the user-entered HTML content (s) as an argument. The print() function then displays the return value of the parse() function on the console.
#This line defines another function named parse(). This function takes a string (s) as an argument, which is expected to be the HTML content containing the YouTube embed code
def parse(s):
    if result := re.search(r'.+src="https?://(?:www\.)?youtube\.com/embed/([a-z0-9A-Z]+)"',s):
        return "https://youtu.be/" + result.group(1)
#This line uses a conditional statement (if) and a regular expression (re.search()) to parse the HTML string. Here's a breakdown:
#if result := ...: This uses a new feature introduced in Python 3.8, called assignment expressions. It assigns the result of the re.search() call to the variable result while also evaluating the expression. So, if the search is successful (i.e., it finds a match), the result variable will hold a Match object containing details about the matched pattern. Otherwise, result will be None.
#re.search(r'...', s): This part uses the re.search() function from the imported re module to search for a pattern in the string s. The pattern is specified within the raw string literal r'...' (indicated by the 'r' prefix).
#The pattern itself is:
#.+: Matches one or more of any character (except newline) to capture everything before the src attribute.
#src=": Matches the literal string "src=" (the source attribute in HTML).
#https?://: Matches either http:// or https:// (protocol for the video source).
#(?:www\.)?: Matches the literal string "www." (optional, allows for YouTube URLs with or without "www.").
#youtube\.com/embed/: Matches "youtube.com/embed/", the specific path for embedded videos.
#([a-z0-9A-Z]+): Captures one or more lowercase, uppercase letters, or numbers into a group (this is the video ID).
#": Matches the closing double quote for the src attribute value.
#This line is executed only if the re.search() in the previous line found a match (i.e., result is not None). It constructs the complete YouTube video URL by:
#"https://youtu.be/": This part is the base URL for YouTube videos in the short format.
#+ result.group(1): This part retrieves the captured video ID from the Match object's first group (index 0). It's appended to the base URL to form the complete video URL.
#The combined string is then returned, which will be printed by the print() function in the main() function.
if __name__ == "__main__": #This line is a common Python idiom for ensuring that the code within this block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).
