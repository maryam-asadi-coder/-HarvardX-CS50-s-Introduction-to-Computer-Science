#import pytest: This line imports the pytest library, which is a popular framework for writing unit tests in Python.
#from fuel import convert, gauge: This line imports the convert and gauge functions from a module named fuel. It's assumed that fuel.py (or a similarly named file) defines these functions.
import pytest
from fuel import convert, gauge
#test_convert: This function tests the convert function from the fuel module. It performs three assertions:
#assert convert("1/2") == 50: This assertion checks if calling convert("1/2") (which presumably converts a fraction string to a percentage) returns 50. If it doesn't, the test fails.
#Similar assertions are made for 99/100 and 1/100.

def test_convert():
    assert convert("1/2") == 50
    assert convert("99/100") == 99
    assert convert("1/100") == 1
#test_gauge: This function tests the gauge function from the fuel module. It performs three assertions to verify the expected output for different input values:
#assert gauge(50) == "50%": This checks if gauge(50) returns the string "50%".
#Similar assertions are made for gauge(99) (expected "F") and gauge(1) (expected "E").

def test_gauge():
    assert gauge(50) == "50%"
    assert gauge(99) == "F"
    assert gauge(1) == "E"
#test_zero_division: This function tests if convert raises a ZeroDivisionError when given a string like "1/0" (which would attempt to divide by zero).
#with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError): This context manager from pytest helps check for expected exceptions. It ensures the test passes only if the following code block (convert("1/0")) raises a ZeroDivisionError.

def test_zero_division():
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        convert("1/0")
#test_value_error (Your line of interest): This function tests if convert raises a ValueError when given a string like "2/1" (which might not be a valid input format for conversion, depending on the implementation of convert).

def test_value_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        convert("2/1")
#with pytest.raises(ValueError): Similar to test_zero_division, this context manager checks for a ValueError.
#convert("2/1"): This line attempts to call convert with the string "2/1". The exact behavior of convert in this case depends on its implementation in the fuel module. If it expects a specific format (e.g., fractions with a denominator less than the numerator) and "2/1" doesn't meet that format, it should raise a ValueError.

#In summary, these test functions ensure that the convert and gauge functions from the fuel module behave as expected for various inputs. They test for correct conversions, expected output for different gauge values, and appropriate exception handling for invalid input.
