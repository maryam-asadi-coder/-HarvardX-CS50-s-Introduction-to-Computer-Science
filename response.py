def main():
    print(is_valid(input("email: ")))
#It prompts the user to enter an email address using input("email: ").
#It calls the is_valid() function with the user's input and prints the returned result.
#is_valid(s): This function takes a string s as input and checks if it's a valid email address.
#It uses checkers.is_email(s) to determine if the string is a valid email.
#If it's valid, it returns "Valid", otherwise it returns "Invalid".
def is_valid(s):
    if checkers.is_email(s):
        return "Valid"
    else:
        return "Invalid"
#if __name__ == "__main__":: This block ensures that the code within it only runs when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
